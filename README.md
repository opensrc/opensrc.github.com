OpenSrc
=======

This is a very eraly attempt at a simple single page application for opensrc.org
but it won't be continued and removed at some point. The Github pages system does
not provide the necessary rewrite rules to make this interface work the way we
want so we'll use lighttpd at opensrc.org for further development.
